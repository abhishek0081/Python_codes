# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

# OOP IS JUST A STYLE/WAY TO WRITE A CODE

# VERY HELPFUL IN CRAFTING REAL WORLD PROGRAMS

# WE WIL SEE OTHER ADVANTAGES WHEN WE WILL LEARNING OOP

#### Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.
#### Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data.
#  Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity.
#  When class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.
#### Methods are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.
#  Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object.
#  Additionally, the subroutines contained in an object are called instance methods.
#  Programmers use methods for reusability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time.
#### Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object.
#  Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself.
# l = [1,2,3,4];
# l.append(8);


arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,8,9,10];
   
print(sorted(arr,key = arr.count,reverse= True));
